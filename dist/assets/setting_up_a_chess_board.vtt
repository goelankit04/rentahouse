00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To build a great building, we need to lay a strong foundation

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Similarly, before we get enter into the cases of the game

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
let's begin with the basics first
"the chess board & the pieces"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's begin to examine the chess board in detail now

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
As you can see, we have 32 dark colour squares 
and 32 white colour squares, making a total of 64

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we can also see there are horizontal lines
which we call them 'ranks'

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and vertical lines, which we call them 'files'.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
there are 8 ranks and 8 files, 
ranks are marked '1 to 8' and the files are marked 'a to h'.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now, we have covered ranks and files
let us explore the concept of diagonals.


00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the highlighted squares on the board
a1 to h8 & h1 to a8, these are called 'the diagonals'


00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
As you can see the diagonals always run accross the white squares 
or the dark squares.


00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let us move to the topic of center
just like the capital city is the source of power for the nation


00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Similarly, with the chess board
the central squares are the most important squares.


00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
whoever controls them has better control over the game.


00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the highlighted square e4, e5, d4, d5
these 4 squares we call as the center of the chess board.


00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
when we develop the pieces, you must develop them
as close towards the center as possible


00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
let us now go to the concepts of 
kingside, queenside and the center


00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
On the screen you see the files marked a, b & c are highlighted
and these are called 'the queenside files'


00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, let's move to the kingside files, these are the files marked
by the alphabets 'h, g & f' so these files are called 'the kingside files'


00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that leaves the 'e & d' files
these are the most important central files.


00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, we are going to understand
the correct way to setup a chess board.


00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
No! that's not the right way.
Can you tell me why?


00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Yes, the right hand corner we have the dark colour square
this is not the right way to setup a chess board. Let's see again.


00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Yes, that's the right way to setup a chess board.


00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We always need to remember, that the bottom right hand square 
should always be a white one.


00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now that we've seen, how to setup a chess board
let's see how the chess board looks from white's perspective.


00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
As you can see the 'h' file is to my right side
and 'a' file is to my left side


00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and the first rank is closer to me
and the eight rank is further away from me


00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
this we need to keep in mind
when we setup a chess board


00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
let's see what happen, when we turn the board around


00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Yeah! now we are looking at the board from black's perspective


00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
as you can see, the 'a' file has move to my right side
and 'h' file has came to my left side


00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and this is how it's usually from black's view point


00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
not only that, we can also see the 8th number rank
is close to me and the 1st number rank is towards my opponent side


00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Yea, let's now see how to name the squares using the co-ordinates


00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
As we've seen earlier the files are marked 'a to h',
and the ranks are marked '1 t0 8'


00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
let's move on the random square d4
let's see how it works 


00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
now we see a, b, c & d moving up all the way
1, 2, 3, 4


00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
As we can see the two lines meet at point d4


00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So, that's how we find the squares


00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
You need to be really good at identifying squares
based on the co-ordinates


00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
beacuse we have to use that to write the
notation on the square sheet


00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
it's time to get chess set out 
because i'm going to ask you a few questions


00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Are you ready?


00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000 
So point out to me the square c6!


00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Yes, that's right! As you can see the a, b, c and the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 meet at this square so that makes it c6 square


00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
now, quickly show me the square g7!


00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Yes! you got it. Very good


00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
now we have covered everything we need to know
about the chess board, let's move to the chess pieces


00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
the King, the most powerful piece in the game
as you can see there is a cross on the top of his head


00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
the abbreviation of the king is K


00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
it has infinite value, the most important piece in the board
the objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king


00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that also means we need to keep our king very safe


00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
THE QUEEN, as you can see there is a crown on top of it's head
it's the second most powerful piece on the board


00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the abbreviation of queen is Q, 
and it has 9 points


00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
THE ROOK, its the third most powerful piece
after the king and the queen


00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the abbreviation for the rook is R,
and it's worth 5 points


00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
The Knight or Horse, it is the 4th most powerful piece
after the king, queen and rook 


00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The abbreviation for the knight is N,
and it's worth 3 points


00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.000
THE BISHOP, it's equivalent to the knight's worth
the abbreviation is B, it's worth 3 points


00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
now we come to the smallest unit, THE PAWN
it's worth 1 point, there are no abbreviations for this


00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
now we have learnt about the chess board and the pieces
let's learn how to setup the pieces on the chess board


00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
there you can see, the rooks occupy the corner squares
followed by the knights 


00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and followed by the bishops


00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that's leaves us with two empty squares in the middle of the board
and that's where the king and queen are going to come


00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
You need to be extremely careful where you plce the king & the queen
because many young children make mistakes here


00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
the queen should always go to it's own colour 
so it occupies the square d1 


00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
leaving the empty square e1 for the king 


00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
there you have the pieces on the 1st rank & the 2nd rank
is completely taken by the pawns


00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
as we have seen we have arrange the pieces of white side 
let's do the same for the black side


00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the rooks go the corner followed by the knights, the bishop
as usual the queen taken its own colour, so the black queen goes to d8


00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
leaving the square e8 for the king 


00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
the pawns as usual occupy the 2nd rank from black's perspective


00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
now that we have learnt how to arrange the pieces
let me ask you a few questions!	


00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
can you rearrange the pieces in their correct positions?


00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
there you have it, very good


00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
let's quickly go through, what we have learnt in this episode


00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
In the next episode, we are going to learn how to move 
the pieces & for the advance and the intermediate guys 


00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
don't worry, lots of more interesting stuff coming to your way
