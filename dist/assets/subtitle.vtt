00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.640
to be a professional athlete,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.500
to be a successful professional athlete.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.740
There's one activity you can't hide from practice.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.620
Tell me about what a good practice looks like to you,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.710
Gary.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.840
Well,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.020
I think importantly,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.830
what?

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.180
Why,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.470
you know,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.790
why would we feel that preparation

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.690
and practice is so necessary to an

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.190
athlete or two cricketer going on to become

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.690
a really good running again?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.300
You just have to look at the top in their fields to see what

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.940
they have done and to really get to understand

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.420
why they see practicing so

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.200
important to the success in in match play.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.440
I think it's probably a number of reasons.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.960
One is they just want to make sure that they feel

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.700
comfortable with their skills,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.450
that they've prepared these skills enough that they can take them out

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.050
on to fuel the play and,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.320
under intense pressure,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.840
be able to execute on those skills

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.500
like I need to this practice.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.200
Is Maura around the physical preparation

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.170
Well,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.370
it's probably a bit of both,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.320
but absolutely I think you're I think your

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.440
physical component Thio to the skill

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.960
that you are trying to master is,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.000
um is crucial.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.440
I mean,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.840
it never goes away.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.360
It's It's not like you can pretend that you don't

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.040
need to do it and still become a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.590
player of the highest quality.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.360
I'm I'm always really interested when I see a young

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.930
guy that's got a lot of skill and to see

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.860
how he improves with that skill,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.540
the more effort in his preparation that he puts it,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.520
It's not necessarily just about preparation.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.770
It's how do we prepare?

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.790
I think that's very important,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.700
you know?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.940
What does it look like when you're going to earn it and you go practice?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.700
And what are you doing in that practice that is really gonna

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.360
be off benefit are out in the middle?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.700
I think you know,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.510
certainly when I was playing,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.580
which is some time ago and you were playing that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.580
practice looked very much like your rather the Nets.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.700
You had a net practice.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.720
You faced some seaman's.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.990
You face some spinach yet if you throw downs afterwards,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.480
then a fielding session and and that was it as

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.010
practice.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.700
His practice changed over over the years.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.380
H.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.770
I think it's changing,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.810
that's for sure.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.390
There's enough demand in the game now,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.010
especially in the modern professional domestic

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.030
game especially.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.980
There just are so many good players around now that your competitive

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.100
advantage is often the one that the guy that works a little

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.660
bit harder the God that understands the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.230
importance off practicing and Heiken

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.900
master he's skill just a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.410
little bit more than more than someone else.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.210
So we certainly put a lot of emphasis.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.760
Is coaches on the importance off practicing?

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.440
And it's not just about coming down

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.190
and having a having a hit for 20 minutes in a net

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.020
facing bowlers,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.400
get out five or six times and then move on.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.490
I think we've gone past that.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.640
Now that you know,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.940
if you've got three hours at a nettle,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.820
what even if it's an honor half What are you doing

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.580
in that time?

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.010
That is gonna help you grow your skill that,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.400
most importantly,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.840
grow your skill under pressure because that's what you're facing

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.570
a Mexico.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.560
So practice for me has become more about

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.480
what do you do in that period of time that's gonna help

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.150
you improve the skill.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.820
There's a full package as well.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.960
It's not only just hitting balls,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.760
you need to be a good field of these days.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.550
You need to be an athlete mentally,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.070
you need to prepare as well.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.440
So there's it's kind of a whole lot to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.510
do that package.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.160
But I really I get really irritated as a coach when

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.990
I see a player come down to a nit and

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.550
kind of just go through the motions a little bit,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.110
we've,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.940
you know,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.200
the way that cricket is being practiced over the last

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.870
70 or 80 years.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.060
We need to move on from that because I think

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.560
the demands of the game,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.500
the professional game specifically requires us

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.840
to use that on a heart for that three

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.390
hours match,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.890
better than what we have in the past.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.370
That's what I think.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.990
I want to test you a little bit when we have the longer versions

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.830
of the game,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.340
whether it be a junior level,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.030
what senior level elite level,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.740
you're asking someone to that for a long period

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.450
of time.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.440
345 hours.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.450
You better for 14 hours in a test match.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.380
But you say he has a 20 minute next session.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.540
How do they prepare to bet for 14

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.340
hours off for four hours when all they're being given is a 20

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.190
minute net session and I do understand You can't

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.920
say bad for 14 hours because you need violins to go.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.020
So how did they go about doing it?

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.140
You know,

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.410
I think notations not only just about

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.140
20 minutes have your pads on and then take your pads off if

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.670
you're a professional.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.370
Vets one.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.410
When I was a professional,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.510
vets one comes down to the net.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.830
He keeps his pads on for the entire time because

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.560
it's it's that 20 minute in it,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.340
and then it's into a throat on station within

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.150
with another coach and work on a specific skill.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.770
Then it beat might be out into the middle.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.510
If you do get a middle way,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.580
you can practice another skill there,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.090
and you certainly master those skills every

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.880
time you come to the net in such a way

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.210
that you are saying,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.200
You know,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.490
I have hit 600 bulls here

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.070
today and that is part of my development

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.220
as a play.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.860
You absolutely spot on the days

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.520
off a 20 minute net

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.380
against bowlers getting out six times in the

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.900
net.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.430
What purpose does that have?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.680
Or relevance is that have to you going out into a little situation

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.760
we're gonna get back to to the net practice.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.500
I just want to go a little bit to the junior side of things and maybe

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.270
pick your brain on what you did.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.540
Often you'll have a young cricketer 10 11

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.170
12 years of age,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.050
just desperate to go,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.760
never hit.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.520
There's no one to have a hit with,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.150
you know,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.840
what can he do in order to hone

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.400
his skills as a cricketer himself?

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.190
So that's a good question On first of all is to find someone to throw

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.820
balls to you on.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.560
I think if you could do that,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.990
it just requires that one person.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.060
If if you were on your own,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.490
you know that I think in ways you can get quite innovative around

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.070
it.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.150
If you're in the backyard or you can hit it's a tennis

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.710
ball against the wall and just work on your kind

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.420
of straight bat swing.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.260
That might be a way it might be a young bowler

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.110
who doesn't necessarily need to bolt it better when you convert

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.820
against a wall,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.790
so they're always that you can practice on your own.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.060
I mean,

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.270
I used to I used to use a sock

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.900
that I used to hang from a tree and I just used to hit the hit

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.560
the ball in the sock and the swing.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.580
The ball would come back and and I would just repeat the action.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.750
For me,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.010
the most important thing is that it's quite complicated the bed

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.670
stream,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.440
although we try and keep it as natural as possible as coaches.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.990
But as complicated as it is,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.620
it requires repetition

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.220
is much repetition.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.230
It's possible the great players in the world

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.890
or a ll tell you that they had a paired in their life

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.280
with a hit.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.790
More balls in this piss,

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.870
quite simply,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.740
and often that was the reason why they became better

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.710
is there is practice dictated to

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.260
by the facility while how good the facility

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.880
is Now.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.380
I have a problem with that because I believe that a lot of

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.280
players become prima donnas in that space

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.830
where they think,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.260
Well,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.360
then it's not great.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.650
Um,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.430
the pictures on good the bowlers on great talk on practice

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.190
for and I think the great players don't find excuses

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.970
there.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.150
They actually go and they find a way

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.650
to have a really good in it or really good practice,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.880
regardless of the conditions that they,

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.400
you know,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.640
they're confronted with again.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.400
When we're working with young players,

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.030
I really like it.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.920
When young players get into a

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.520
space where they really want to hit

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.090
balls well,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.220
they really want to bowl double or they really want to take

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.760
catches.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.740
You know,

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.010
for me,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.530
I get excited as a coach because I've not said this guy's interested

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.460
in increasing his volume in his practice,

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.430
and he's doing it by his own

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.090
admission.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.630
Rather than being told.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.430
You need to do this in a practice.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.910
When I see that young guy,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.040
I get very excited because I know he's interested.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.490
He's keen,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.950
he's determined and he's not prepared to put in the yard

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.680
to become a better player.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.040
Is that what is the environment that you as a coach,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.630
trying to provide for the team

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.390
in order for them to have the best possible

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.980
practice?

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.740
Well,

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.090
as a coach,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.580
we gotta be organized.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.460
Evan,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.660
we you know,

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.190
we've got a sale.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.910
How much time do I have with these bunch of plays?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660
Maybe it's 90 minutes.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.720
I can say What can I do in 90 minutes where everyone

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.670
feels that they walked out of the out of that

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.260
practice knowing that they're covered a lot of

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.820
the skills that they're going to be confronted with in a match.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.630
The more organized I am is a coach,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.980
the bed of the practice,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.580
and for me,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.130
we often go through the motions as coaches.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.090
You know,

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.430
we will have a fielding session and you'll have

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.940
10 guys standing in a line behind one another,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.660
and each guy's taking probably two or three catches in the whole

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.180
next session.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.700
Where is what you can do is you can get creative and make sure that

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.610
you know you can really old repetition

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.060
in that training session.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.120
So,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.940
you know,

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.180
practicing for me in that space.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.220
If the coach is really organized,

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.050
you can and fantastic value to Young.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.390
There's a number of players that will come to a practice unless you've

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.920
organized an individual one,

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.770
and it must be quite a bit of it.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.820
We might be one that arrives with a bad attitude who doesn't

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.770
feel like practicing is that your role is the coast of able to

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.320
pick it up in address it before sort of infests

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.120
the whole practice.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.410
Yeah,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.580
absolutely I would want to want to help that young player

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.330
understand the importance of practicing if it's

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.970
two or three plays and it becomes a bit more of a problem,

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.800
I think importantly for me,

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.130
um,

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.560
as a coach,

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.040
I need to sell to the players

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.230
the importance off practicing and how

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.810
relevant what we do.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.650
Yeah,

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.230
in our training is to what you're going to do

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.140
in a Mexican oration.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.240
I would be very irritated,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.510
for example,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.860
if a guy got out trying to pull a short delivery from

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.520
a fast Tyler and top invisible and gets

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.200
out.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.130
But he's never practiced it in the Nets.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.630
That shot.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.340
And then I'm saying two more while you're playing the shot.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.440
If you've never practiced it,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.100
there has to be a connection between what you're doing

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.330
in a practice session on DDE what you're gonna

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.850
be doing.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.880
You've highlighted over a number of the programs that

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.500
we've done is being a being a sentence that has stuck

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.200
out for me around.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.290
There's not necessarily a right and a wrong.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.010
You've been strong on that.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.200
Is there a rot?

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.280
Is there a rot away to practice and is there a wrong way

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.840
to practice.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.330
Well,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.490
I think the importance around practice is Are you

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.260
Are you creating some some purpose

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.350
in what you're doing?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.700
The only thing that I'm interested in is that there's a close

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.280
link between what you're doing in your preparation.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.910
Do what you're doing.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.850
New matches.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.500
I mean,

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.690
I think you can go across the whole lot of sports

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.500
and you can watch tennis players.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.780
You can watch golfers in the way that they practice

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.670
and how important it is to replicate

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.540
what they might be getting in a match situation.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.690
I don't like it when young players come

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.270
into a knit situation and are prepared to make errors,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.720
which they know is going to cost them

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.240
big time in a match situation.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.860
Then why you doing it for it,

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.640
for a simple example is why would Why would

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.210
a young fast Tyler all nobles

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.500
in the net when he's going to get penalized

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.550
in a match situation?

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.610
It doesn't make sense to me and I think for glasses

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.260
cultures if our attention to detail is really good there,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.780
then we are not let me on away.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.880
Repetition repetition,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.730
repetition volume volume

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.310
volume for me is critical as a coach

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.540
to making sure that a player is mastering

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.550
the skills that he that he requires.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.030
We've spoken quite a bit about practicing

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.040
in a team environment.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.640
What about individual individual practicing

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.470
with a one on one coach?

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.040
Yes,

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.440
I think that's also important for a young player

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.000
because often when you're in a team space,

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.970
you don't really get enough practice,

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.970
repetition and volume in.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.790
So it's not sometimes to go into a one on one session

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.480
where you can actually just focus on just what you

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.040
need to do in your skills.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.680
I do a lot of work like that as a as a coach,

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.320
I might have an hour with a young Bettman and

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.860
I have an opportunity to maybe throw 300 balls

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.520
at him,

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.850
which is an average first of 300 bowls.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.920
That's 50 overs of betting that one guy

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.600
gets in one hour session,

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.140
so he gets a lot of work and he can improve.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.590
I'm very quickly through that process.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.060
I'm really a fen because the skills are quite

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.650
complicated in cricket.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.780
To have those one on one session so

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.410
that you can grow that skill.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.680
You running academy,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.130
I'd be interested to know how you manage the player

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.660
and all the information that he's being given

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.640
about how to play at the various sort of places

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.540
where he gets when he gets catching.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.960
So Arbeit school,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.450
plus a representative side,

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.210
plus his favorite one on one coach and now he

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.730
goes to your academy.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.750
I mean,

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.910
that's Phil.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.390
Lots of different information.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.720
Yeah,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.020
I mean,

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.310
listen,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.620
the perfect scenario is that all the coaches are lined

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.130
and giving the same mrs.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.240
But that's not gonna happen,

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.230
is it?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.580
And,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.820
uh,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.500
I get very frustrated.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.640
And,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.240
um,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.100
I have sympathy for the young player when he gets

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.900
fed a lot of different pieces of information.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.340
I,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.480
interestingly enough often it'll just be

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.240
a different kind of language but actually meaning the same

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.020
thing.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.620
But then then trip interpretation of what the coach is

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.130
saying is really tough for the for the young player.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.420
So whenever I coach a young guy that I haven't seen much,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.600
I'll always say to him,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.460
This is my best thinking on your game,

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.890
and it's your responsibility to decide

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.460
for yourself what is relevant to you

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.170
or not.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:11.500
If it's a real small guy,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.870
like in a 9 10 and 11 year old.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.240
My view is that a lot of the information

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.970
from all the different cultures will probably be fairly similar.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.730
But when the kid is a bit more advanced,

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.040
different information can be interpreted in a

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.570
very different way.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.680
So for me,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.250
I always throw that responsibility onto the young

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.900
player.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.240
But I do make sure that he understands from

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.830
my side this is my best thinking in terms of

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.400
what I see in your game and how do I

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.900
qualify that?

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.210
Well,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.940
I've been involved the game a long time.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.530
I've watched a lot of the best players in the world,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.490
and I look at the shape of the way you're betting,

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.920
bowling or feeling,

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.630
and I'm trying to find that shape

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.170
in you that looks a bit like you.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.660
That would work.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.110
You've given us the advantages to having

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.830
one on one practice the 300 balls in an hour

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.050
compared to maybe a team environment.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.340
What can the player get from being involved in

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.070
in academy?

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.900
Not necessarily yours,

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.850
but for this,

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.890
for the circumstances,

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.300
your academy,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.140
what benefit can not give the player

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.040
well,

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.300
apart from apart from the one on one work,

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.450
he would be working and spending time with other players.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.200
It was invested into the academy,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.260
and I think we have a lot of joint conversations

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.770
in that space around around understanding

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.740
how you can improve your game.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.880
So,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.760
you know,

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.010
we always like to bring a lot of the individuals

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.720
together for a period of time and maybe have a session

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.340
around a specific skill.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.110
And then they all get to participate jointly in

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.620
the next session,

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.840
and then they grow their skill.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.740
Let's remember that winner when a

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.330
player invests into

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.260
a private academy,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.840
my role is ahead of that academies to make sure

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.460
that we add value for that investment

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.490
as best that we can for that specifically for that individual.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.540
So we always mindful off on the balance

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.150
between doing a lot of one on one word because that's

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.800
essentially what he wants.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.660
But at the same time,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.560
the odds,

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.690
um,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.240
on a group session where he can get

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.790
some more generic learning.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.440
Okay,

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.710
so if we have to just finish off this son

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.230
on practice here,

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.390
if I have to ask you to sum it up,

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.410
what does an ideal practice of a clock for

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.090
an individual player.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.840
Quite simply,

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.420
quality and quality is around bolding.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.210
Good habits and good behaviors.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.240
And the 2nd 1 is quantity.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.800
Which is how do you repeat those good behaviors

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.420
and those good qualities that you want to bring into

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.950
your practicing time and time and time again?

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.280
Yes.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.490
We've got some great insights there into what a good practice

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.030
looks like for a team as well as for an individual

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.830
player.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.430
You can't avoid it.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.620
You need to do it.
